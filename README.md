IMF Global Low Carbon Tech Trade &amp; Impact

Data Size: 2144 rows and 42 columns.

This data analysis comprehensive insights into the trade of low carbon technology products on a global scale, sourced from IMF records. Low carbon technologies, which include solar panels, wind turbines, biomass systems, and carbon capture equipment, are crucial in the transition to a sustainable future. By analyzing trade flows, exports, and imports of these technologies, this dataset aims to highlight the economic impact of sustainable energy and technology adoption worldwide.

Highlights

Trade Metrics: Includes yearly data from 1994 to 2023 on exports, imports, and comparative advantage for low carbon products.

Economic Indicators: Understand the growth and flow of sustainable technologies across different countries, providing a snapshot of global trends in renewable energy trade.

Sustainable Development Impact: Explore how countries are embracing low carbon technologies to achieve climate change goals and move towards a greener economy.

Purpose: The primary goal of this dataset is to illuminate the trends in low-carbon technology trade, empowering policymakers, researchers, and analysts to make informed decisions on sustainability initiatives.

Context: This dataset is pivotal for evaluating the global push towards a low-carbon economy. It provides critical insights into which countries are leading the way in adopting and promoting sustainable technologies.
CONCLUSION:
In this project, there is a great resource for creating data visualizations and building predictive models that analyze trade and economic growth through the lens of renewable technologies.

 Following are the inferences regarding the project: 
- It gives us an idea for researchers and policymakers interested in analyzing the role of low-carbon technologies in tackling climate change.
- Economists can utilize this data to understand the effect of trade policies and sustainability initiatives on low carbon technologies.
- Create heatmaps of export/import values by countries over the years.
- Forecast future trade growth in low carbon technology products using machine learning.
-  Compare low carbon technology adoption among countries and their economic development.
Last but not least, it provides valuable economic indicators to better understand how nations are trading and utilizing low-carbon technologies to meet climate goals.
